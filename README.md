# Big Man Discord Bot

### Big Man

Big Man is an advanced nextcord/discord.py bot created to provide entertainment! Economy, Leveling, General & Slash Commands! (Based on Splatoon 3)

Use `manta assistance` or `manta assist` to view all the commands! They will be directly messaged to you for saving.
*(Using the help command will send a message asking you to use `manta assistance` instead.)*

#### Assistance Fields

- `Common`
- `Management`
- `Entertainment`
- `Economy`
- `Leveling`
- `Holder` *(Restricted to BOT OWNERS only)*

#### Other

I don't wanna spoil it all, but there are quite a few special commands and probably more to come!

Economy comes with various of commands that are related to Splatoon in general, may not be the best but its something!

Gain **BMD** *(Big Man Dollars)* in Turf Wars/Battles with a bot. Simply use `manta turf` or `/turf`
There is also an **Extreme** version of this that less your chances and gives you more **BMD**! Simply use `manta extreme-turf` or `/extreme-turf`

Buying items from the market are usually one of your most useful resources! Items there can boost your chances in winning turf or blitz, sometimes even just win in general!

Speaking of "Blitz", there is a game that you play with a bot with the leveling system. Its called **Experience Blitz** and it could be one of the most easiest ways to earn experience in your guild!

Getting into more depth with the bot, you could find some more things you can do! For any bugs found, please use the `/bug` command for reporting it, this will be received and hopefully looked into.
Any feature request can also be submitted with `/request`! Any feature request are appreciated, and might be added into the Big Man Bot!

If you've invited this bot to your guild/server, thank you!
*Also, Splatoon 3 release was great, wasn't it?*
